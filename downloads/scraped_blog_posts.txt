Title: EigenLayer x LayerZero: The CryptoEconomic DVN Framework
Eigen Labs, in partnership with LayerZero Labs, is introducing a framework for CryptoEconomic Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs). Eigen Labs chose LayerZero because it is one of the most battle-tested protocols in crypto, handling millions of messages and securing billions for apps.
As the first step of this integration, we are proud to announce that Eigen Labs and LayerZero Labs have jointly developed a CryptoEconomic DVN Framework which allows anyone to easily bootstrap a DVN on EigenLayer using any tokens and operators.
The first DVN to utilize this novel Framework is the LayerZero Labs DVN.  It implements a system that accepts EIGEN, ZRO, and ETH as staking assets. The Framework is open source, allowing other teams to launch their own CryptoEconomic DVNs using their own assets as stake.
This article explains how EigenLayer and LayerZero complement each other and dives into the implementation of the CryptoEconomic DVN Framework.
Eigen Labs and LayerZero Labs share a vision of building a verifiable internet across blockchains, driven by permissionless security. One where anyone can participate in securing the network and verifying the integrity of messages across chains.
Previously, the security of verifying omnichain messages was solely based on the DVN’s verification mechanism. But now, with Eigenlayer’s re-staking primitive, anyone can stake their assets to provide an extra layer of security (i.e. CryptoEconomic security) to DVNs.
At its core, EigenLayer allows participants to stake any assets or restake assets that are already securing a protocol like Ethereum to secure additional services, applications, or verification mechanisms. By leveraging Ethereum’s existing trust and capital, EigenLayer’s innovation is to create a shared pool of security that can be extended to multiple use cases.
This coordinated security model enables the CryptoEconomic DVN Framework, where verifiers are incentivized to act honestly, knowing that misbehavior will be punished through slashing.
LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables secure communication across 80+ blockchains, from Ethereum to Solana.
Each application customizes its security by selecting a DVN or set of DVNs to verify its messages, with the choice based on the sensitivity of the data. For example, an NFT project might use a single proof-of-authority DVN for simple transfers, while a DEX may select multiple DVNs with diverse verification methods for critical governance votes. Currently, 35 entities participate as DVNs, including zk-proof-based teams like Polyhedra, multi-bridge attestations from Hashi, and oracles like Google Cloud. This essentially makes LayerZero a marketplace for verifiers.
The CryptoEconomic DVN Framework will supercharge this competition by allowing ANY DVN to transparently demonstrate its reliability through the value of staked assets and the subsequent risk of slashing. This reflects a DVN’s commitment to verifying messages accurately, without malicious behavior or downtime.
The first team to launch a CryptoEconomic DVN secured by EigenLayer restaking is LayerZero Labs.
The LayerZero Labs DVN, which has verified over 100 million messages historically, is transitioning from a PoA model to one backed by restaking. (Note: LayerZero Labs is a development team building infra for LayerZero protocol. The protocol itself is DVN-agnostic.)
Specifically, staked tokens—ZRO, ETH, and EIGEN—provide economic security for message verification for applications that choose the LayerZero Labs DVN as part of its security stack. If the DVN fails to act correctly or experiences downtime, the staked tokens are at risk of being slashed, giving application developers a clear, measurable way to assess the security of the DVN.
The CryptoEconomic DVN Framework co-developed by Eigen Labs and LayerZero Labs is open and generalized, meaning any team can design and deploy its own DVN Actively Validated Service (AVS).
This gives applications the flexibility to create CryptoEconomic DVNs, where they can define slashing conditions and choose any assets that can be staked based on their specific requirements.
The introduction of EigenLayer – and therefore cryptoeconomic security via restaking –into omnichain messages changes the risk profile of deploying an application across many chains, allowing developers to trust DVNs based on the economic stake at risk of slashing.
This shift moves away from trust-based systems to economically quantifiable security that can be audited onchain and configured in any way (since the architecture is open and permissionless).
With EigenLayer’s restaking model and LayerZero’s messaging framework, developers now have the tools to build highly secure, application-specific DVNs that are economically incentivized to act honestly. As more applications adopt cryptoeconomic security, we hope to see a proliferation of CryptoEconomic DVNs securing a variety of use-cases.
This collaboration marks only the beginning of a broader partnership between Eigen Labs and LayerZero Labs. As more innovations unfold, the combined strength of cryptoeconomic security and omnichain messaging will continue to drive the future of a better internet, built across blockchains.

Title: Intelligent DeFi

Thanks to Karthik, Ismael from Lagrange, Nikhil from Aethos, Soubhik, Gautham, and Brandon for reviewing drafts of this piece.
Ethereum gave birth to DeFi with the launch of Maker in December 2017. Uniswap and Compound launched soon after, forming an economy around ETH and ERC20s. Since then, we’ve witnessed an onchain financial renaissance with concentrated liquidity enabling greater capital efficiency, the evolution of perps, and even the invention of flash loans, a concept not possible in tradfi.
But we seem to have hit a wall. AMM LPs have lost >$700M in MEV since The Merge. Derivative exchanges have centralized their risk engines and orderbooks for greater efficiency. And we’re unable to provide personalized loans, giving better rates to those with lower default risk or easy access to fixed-rate loans for set periods of time.
Many of the problems stem from Ethereum’s constraints as a finite state machine. It’s gas-constrained, has 12-second block times, and can’t natively take in offchain data. Modular architectures provide a way forward by offloading heavy computation and integrating external data without sacrificing Ethereum’s core security.
If the EVM is the glue that lets developers write arbitrary business logic, then what form should the coprocessors take? While Vitalik describes these coprocessors as precompiles or opcodes, we need a broader solution. We need coprocessors that can handle tasks too computationally expensive or impractical for Ethereum’s limited state machine, and—most importantly—they must be verifiable.
Developers have been building efficient, specialized services for years, but verifiability changes the game entirely. This is where EigenLayer comes in: it provides the infrastructure to create decentralized networks of node operators, economically aligned to run your arbitrary node software.
We call these decentralized networks Actively Validated Services (AVSs), and they drastically decrease the cost of building verifiable, trustless services.
The intersection of DeFi and AVSs unlocks a range of powerful new use cases:
We call this new paradigm Intelligent DeFi because it brings real-time adaptability and personalization to decentralized finance. Leveraging trustless offchain compute and data, Intelligent DeFi enables smarter decisions. In this blog, we dive into 10 use cases that showcase its potential.
Exchanges are a core primitive of DeFi, yet less than 15% of spot and 6% of derivatives trading happens onchain. Intelligent DeFi can close this gap, making DEXs more competitive with their offchain counterparts.
Centralized exchanges offer tiered fees based on volume, not just to build loyalty, but to subsidize market makers, enabling them to quote tighter spreads and offer better prices to retail traders. This generates more volume for the exchange.
Implementing volume-based fees on a DEX is challenging. To determine traders’ volumes, a DEX would need to either:
Both methods are prohibitively expensive onchain. But by outsourcing computation to a coprocessor like Lagrange or Brevis, we can verifiably compute traders’ volumes for every transaction.
How does this work?
Loss versus rebalancing (LVR) is a major problem affecting LP profitability in AMMs. LVR occurs due to the price discrepancies between continuously trading offchain exchanges and onchain AMMs, which only trade every block or 12 seconds for Ethereum Mainnet. A lot can happen in a block, and at the start of the next block, searchers arbitrage price differences between exchanges.
To improve LP profitability, AMMs can introduce dynamic fees and asymmetric fees:
In both cases, AMMs need trusted external data—like CEX prices or volatility—to adjust fees. But traditional oracles introduce risks: centralized operators can fail or deliver stale data. Instead, zkTLS (web proofs) offers a better approach. By cryptographically verifying data directly from web servers, zkTLS removes the need to trust third parties. It gives you tamper-proof data in real-time, ensuring AMMs can compute dynamic, asymmetric fees securely, whether onchain or through a coprocessor.
Another way to boost LP profitability involves not just offchain compute, but a decentralized auction network. Currently, searchers compete in auctions to get their transactions at the top of the block. Effectively, the arbitrage goes to a mix of searchers, builders, and proposers, rather than the LPs and swappers.
Instead, AMMs can auction off the right to be the first swap through the pool. If the auction is competitive, most of the LVR will be recaptured. This can then be distributed pro-rata to the underlying LPs in the range of the swap, reducing overall arbitrage and enabling LPs to provide tighter spreads. Sorella is building this in the form of a Uniswap v4 hook.
The challenge is running a low-latency, censorship-resistant auction. It’d be too complex and expensive to run the auction onchain: each bid would require gas. By the time the winner is chosen, a block would have passed, rendering the auction incomplete. A centralized party could conduct the auction offchain, but this goes against the general ethos of DeFi, while also giving them a last look to potentially extract value for themself.
The solution is a decentralized set of operators running a leaderless auction, eliminating the need for a single entity and preserving the integrity of the process. The operators select the winning bid and return proceeds to LPs.
From Paradigm’s Leaderless Auctions
While most derivatives are traded on exchanges, Intelligent DeFi unlocks unique use cases specific to this asset class. Let’s dive in!
Currently, traders can’t express cross-asset viewpoints, like SOLETH or cross, without severely limiting their leverage. Most perp DEXs calculate margin linearly based on the sum of a trader’s open interest across different positions.
For example, if I deposit $10k and take a $50k long on ETH and a $50k short on BTC, that counts as 10x leverage. But this is a different risk profile from someone who simply longs $100k on ETH, and these accounts shouldn’t be treated the same. Ideally, traders should be able to leverage more than 5x ETHBTC without facing such rigid constraints.
The issue lies in onchain compute limits. Specifically, the system needs to account for collaterals (of every spot asset), positions (of every perp asset), unrealized PnL, each perp’s initial and maintenance margin factors, and correlations / delta hedging. This is especially true as DEXs expand to multiple asset types, like perps and options.
By leveraging a coprocessor for more complex calculations to determine accounts’ margin factors, DEXs can create a more customized risk engine tailored to their users’ needs. This enables more flexible, delta-neutral strategies and ensures that liquidations only happen when truly necessary.
To offer even more flexibility, coprocessors can adjust margin requirements dynamically, factoring in real-time liquidity from major CEXs and the open interest in each pool.
AMMs for derivatives, especially options, are exciting yet controversial. Some believe that they can never be priced accurately; others believe that derivatives only make sense for high-volume assets and that orderbooks are superior for said assets. Nonetheless, Panoptic, Deri, and others believe that AMMs are the ultimate method to provide liquidity, including for options.
For an options AMM to truly take off, one key factor will be the inclusion of offchain data—such as volatility, historical pricing, and real-time market signals. Additionally, offchain compute will be necessary to model more advanced pricing frameworks like Black-Scholes. Integrating these external data points with onchain trading mechanisms will be crucial to ensure accurate pricing, lower slippage, and better capital efficiency for options traders.
Lending protocols face unique challenges, where AI and offchain compute can drive smarter, more dynamic solutions.
Currently, governance manually updates parameters around lending markets in protocols like Aave and Compound. Generally, a risk service provider like Gauntlet runs model-based simulations and proposes changes to parameters like base rates, collateral factors, liquidation factors, and more. During more serious incidents, they can propose to delist or freeze an asset.
This appr`oach has two major flaws:
Morpho and Euler v2 move a step in the right direction. They modularize the risk management portion, enabling anyone to curate their own instance of a lending platform. Users choose where to park their assets based on the curator’s track record and reputation. This approach can minimize delays in updating parameters.
But in an ideal system, parameters would update automatically, responding in real-time to both onchain and offchain liquidity. AI-driven models simulate various scenarios, predicting and preventing worst-case outcomes. These models rely on AI-focused coprocessors like Ritual, Sentient, Hyperbolic, Ora, and Valence to process vast amounts of data offchain—accounting for volatility, liquidity shifts, and risk correlations—before verifiably publishing results onchain.
In traditional finance, borrowers with strong credit histories receive better loan terms, but in DeFi, everyone gets the same lending terms, regardless of their risk profile or track record. While beneficial, I believe DeFi has the ability to combine the best of both worlds: offering fair trustless loans to anyone, and loans with favorable terms to repeat, identified borrowers with low liquidation risk.
Without differentiation, DeFi lending protocols can’t offer customized terms, such as lower collateral requirements or better interest rates, to low-risk borrowers. This lack of personalization not only limits the potential upside for repeat users but also makes lending markets inefficient.
Offering personalized loans first requires an anti-sybil solution to ensure that only verified users receive better terms. Solutions like WorldCoin or Coinbase Verifications prevent malicious actors from repeatedly exploiting the protocol with bad debt.
Once borrowers are verified, the protocol can collect onchain information to build a liquidity profile, including:
The protocol can even look at other addresses tied to the same identity to get a more holistic view!
Finally, a coprocessor can assess liquidation risk and generate custom collateral factors and interest rates, ensuring tailored loan terms for each borrower.
In August 2022, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash for enabling money laundering. Privacy, however, is a fundamental right and serves legitimate purposes: people should be able to transfer funds to another account or a friend without exposing their full transaction history.
The problem is that existing privacy mixers don’t differentiate between legitimate users and bad actors. This lack of compliance makes them a target for sanctions and prevents broader adoption.
What if we could create a privacy protocol that only accepts compliant funds? The protocol would manage risks and adhere to regulations, and privacy-conscious users would flock to the system. But determining compliance requires various onchain and offchain data and is a nontrivial task. Ideally, smart contracts can call an API that enforces compliance by approving only valid transactions.
Aethos is a policy layer that does exactly this. It enables developers to set rules at the smart contract level, ensuring that transactions follow specific compliance policies. For example, a compliant privacy mixer could set rate limits, time locks, and block transactions in which the depositing or withdrawing address is OFAC-sanctioned or tied to a DeFi hack.
Incorporating real-time, rule-based policies into smart contracts opens a new wave of institutional-friendly DeFi, where compliance and DeFi values are no longer at odds.
DeFi offers an abundance of yield opportunities, across various assets and protocols—staking, restaking, lending, AMM liquidity pools, RWAs, and more. Users each have unique risk preferences, tied to the protocol type, chain (Ethereum, Solana, etc.), and asset denomination, along with external market risks. With so many choices, some traders turn to yield protocols to automate their capital allocation.
These protocols can leverage AI models to optimize yields across multiple sources. Developers set predefined risk parameters (e.g., capping exposure to 15% per protocol or avoiding protocols with under $100M in TVL), and AI models handle the rest, adjusting the portfolio to meet these criteria while maximizing returns.
Going further, AI models can create fully customized yield strategies for each user, based on their onchain activity and preferences collected through a brief questionnaire. This level of personalization—previously unthinkable—is now within reach, thanks to the scalability of AI.
On the backend, AI-driven coprocessors monitor and rebalance portfolios. They only trigger changes when the benefits justify the gas costs, ensuring efficient, data-driven portfolio management.
Incentives are core to crypto and DeFi. DeFi summer only truly kicked off with Compound’s introduction of liquidity mining in 2020. By offering rewards for specific user actions, protocols were able to bootstrap growth and activity.
But as the space matures, protocols are seeking more precise targeting and often move to offchain programs. AMMs may focus on incentivizing active liquidity. NFT marketplaces and prediction markets might reward liquidity near the orderbook price. Lending protocols could encourage borrowing from non-loopers for at least 20% of their interest.
With coprocessors, protocols can define complex reward conditions and issue payouts in real time. This moves away from the increasingly unpopular points system and provides users with certainty that rewards will be paid, reducing the cost of capital for protocols. Gearbox is already shifting to Lagrange’s coprocessor to handle multi-asset rewards with different payout mechanics. By making incentives more efficient, DeFi can continue to grow while rewarding the most valuable actions.
The intersection of DeFi and AVSs will lead to a new financial revolution. From MEV-recapturing AMMs to real-time policies in privacy protocols, these use cases are just a glimpse of what can be built when we push the limits of decentralized finance.

Title: Introducing Programmatic Incentives v1

The Eigen Foundation is excited to announce the upcoming Programmatic Incentives v1 release, a new EigenLayer protocol feature, providing programmatic EIGEN rewards to stakers and operators for their active participation in supporting AVSs.
What
Programmatic Incentives v1 will enable weekly programmatic rewards of newly-minted EIGEN tokens to qualifying stakers and the operators they delegate to. These incentives will be retroactive based on staking since August 15, 2024, and will become claimable on a weekly basis starting in October 2024. Details and timeline for claiming are provided below.
In the first year, Programmatic Incentives v1 will distribute ~66,945,866 EIGEN, equivalent to 4% of the EIGEN token’s initial supply of ~1,673,646,668 tokens:
Distribution
Programmatic Incentives v1 is initially configured to distribute EIGEN as follows:
Qualification
To receive Programmatic Incentives:
The Programmatic Incentives distribution and eligibility configurations will evolve over time, adapting to the changing needs of the ecosystem to incentivize valuable engagement with protocol features and securing the AVSs built on top.  Future updates that are being explored include:
Claiming
Programmatic Rewards employs the same Rewards infrastructure that is now available for all AVSs to distribute rewards to stakers and operators, and will accrue and be claimable by stakers and operators in the same place and in the same way as Rewards from EigenDA and other AVSs.
Weekly programmatic rewards will be available to claim every Tuesday at 19:00 UTC. Below is the anticipated timeline for rollout of Programmatic Incentives v1 and opening of claims for programmatic rewards:
Accrued weekly programmatic rewards will not expire and can be claimed at any time after they accrue, beginning on Tuesday, October 8, 2024:
Why
This upcoming release marks a significant milestone for EigenLayer and the broader restaking ecosystem as EigenLayer transitions from retroactive incentives (points and stakedrops) towards continuous liquid rewards via Programmatic Incentives, ultimately creating a market for price discovery of shared security.
Upon release of Programmatic Incentives v1 on mainnet, a followup blogpost will be published with more details on technical implementation, claiming considerations, and links to supporting documentation and resources.

Title: Introducing the EigenLayer Security Model: A Novel Approach to Operating and Securing Decentralized Services

Eigen Labs is excited to introduce the EigenLayer Security Model, an evolution of our previous model, in preparation for the upcoming ‘Slashing’ protocol feature release.
This blog post is a simple description of how EigenLayer empowers AVSs to operate more efficiently and create economically aligned incentives using three foundational concepts: Operator Sets, Total Stake, and Unique Stake. In upcoming articles, we will dive deeper into the technical details of the planned protocol updates, uncovering the full potential and advantages of EigenLayer’s innovative design.
For additional context, we have included in the appendix a brief description of what properties this new model is trying to achieve in comparison to the original.1
An Operator Set is a group of operators who have been delegated ETH by stakers and are assigned certain tasks by an AVS. Although EigenLayer accepts many different types of tokens, and multiple tokens can be used in a single Operator Set, for simplicity, we will proceed using only staked ETH, which we will refer to simply as ETH.
Stakers delegate ETH to operators who participate in various Operator Sets created by AVSs.2 To join Operator Sets, operators send requests to the respective AVSs for inclusion. AVSs can reward operators within an Operator Set if they perform their assigned tasks correctly and impose penalties if they do not. An AVS can create as many different Operator Sets as it wants.
The total amount of ETH delegated to an operator is the Total Stake of that operator. An Operator Set’s Total Stake is the sum of all its operators Total Stake. For example, if there are 3 operators in an Operator Set and each has 100 ETH delegated to them, then the Total Stake for each operator is 100 ETH, and the Total Stake for that Operator Set is 300 ETH.
Operators allocate a percentage of their ETH that an Operator Set is permitted to slash. An operator’s total allocation across Operator Sets must be between 0% and 100%. In other words, a unit of ETH can only be slashed by a single Operator Set at any given time. The allocated amount of ETH is called the operator's Unique Stake for that Operator Set.
If a task is performed incorrectly, the Operator Set may choose to slash an operator for up to that amount as defined by the AVS. The Unique Stake of an Operator Set is the amount of ETH exclusively slashable by that Operator Set.
Building on our previous example, if an AVS has one Operator Set and the three operators allocate 0%, 10%, and 20% of their ETH to it, their Unique Stake would be 0, 10 and 20 ETH, respectively, totaling 30 ETH in Unique Stake for the Operator Set.
AVSs can use the Total Stake and Unique Stake of an Operator Set for security. For example, consider an AVS creates a single Operator Set which has operators perform a task and vote on its output. The output that receives more than 50% of the stake-weighted vote is deemed correct. We assume that all pre-existing operators are honest and cannot be bribed to corrupt the task.
Using the numbers from our previous example, if the Operator Set weighs votes solely by Total Stake, a new malicious operator could manipulate the task’s result (attack) by allocating slightly more than 300 ETH in Total Stake (eg. 301 ETH). Without the ability to slash, no penal action can be taken against this operator besides ejection from the Operator Set.
To use slashing as a punitive disincentive for misbehavior, the Operator Set can instead weigh votes by Unique Stake. In this case, the malicious operator would need to allocate just over 30 ETH in Unique Stake to carry out an attack (e.g. 30.1 ETH). Afterward, the Operator Set can slash the malicious operator for 30.1 ETH. While this imposes a tangible economic penalty, it significantly lowers the capital requirement from 301 ETH to 30.1 ETH.
An Operator Set could also require agreement between votes based on both Total Stake and Unique Stake, effectively balancing their weaknesses and leveraging their strengths. This approach forces a new malicious operator to meet the higher threshold of 301 ETH in Total Stake to compromise the task’s result while committing 30.1 ETH in Unique Stake that can be slashed after the attack. Thus, the Total Stake raises the capital required to corrupt the task, while the Unique Stake ensures an economic penalty for the malicious operator.
Thus far, we have provided a simplified demonstration of how this security model works. In reality, Operator Sets are far more versatile. For example, an Operator Set can include multiple tasks and tokens, none of which need to be ETH. It can specify slashing conditions for different types of tokens, tasks, and infractions, as well as define confirmation rules for the set of tasks. An Operator Set can determine which tokens will be used to reward operators and how these rewards will be distributed. This model is also extensible to accommodate various preferences for handling slashed stake, including burning or redistribution (see StakeSure), although redistribution will not be available in the initial slashing release. Finally, because an Operator Set’s Unique Stake is only slashable by that specific Operator Set, slashing is localized, eliminating the need for a common veto committee.
In future articles we will delve into the nuances of the security model, why it is an improvement over other models, and other components that are actively being researched.
1 What is the new model trying to accomplish?
The original security model had the following structure: each operator can opt into a subset of AVSs, and the entire stake delegated to that operator could be slashed by any of those AVSs, which meant:
The new EigenLayer security model described in the blog post above has been specifically designed to address these shortcomings by offering greater flexibility and control:
2 Stakers can delegate to only one operator per address. For example, as shown in Figure 1, stakers collectively have delegated 100 ETH to each of the three operators. However, behind the scenes, each staker uses three separate addresses, with each one delegating to a specific operator.
Consider Figure 5 below in the context of Figure 1:

Title: Introducing Updated EigenDA Pricing: Unlocking Greater Value and Accessibility

EigenDA’s mission is to scale the decentralized world by making reliable, scalable, and secure data availability (‘DA’) abundant. In pursuit of this goal, and enabled by the scalability of its design, EigenDA strives to be the most price-performant DA solution.
Today, we are pleased to announce a 10x reduction in EigenDA pricing for both on-demand and reserved bandwidth customers.
In addition, we are introducing a ‘free tier’ with up to 1.28KiB/s in throughput for developers to get started on mainnet for up to 12 months.
Note that both previous and new pricing will start to apply once payments go live later this year. Please get in touch with us if you are launching soon.
As always, testnet remains free to use, but by default is rate limited to 3.1 KiB/s and testnet network performance can be highly variable. If you'd like to run tests at higher throughputs please contact us and we can work with you to design a performance and scalability test.
The new EigenDA pricing can be found below:
EigenDA distributes most of the fees as rewards to the stakers and operators that power the network. Eigen Labs will use a portion of the fees to fund development and operating costs, which include cloud costs and gas fees paid to Ethereum L1 for bridging DA certificates.
Customers interested in testing or launching on mainnet, please fill out our EigenDA Contact Form.
Please find official EigenLayer and EigenDA resources below:

Title: Coming Soon: Permissionless Token Support on EigenLayer

Eigen Labs is proud to introduce Permissionless Token Support, an upcoming update, to the EigenLayer protocol. This feature will enable any ERC-20 token to be permissionlessly added as a restakable asset, significantly broadening the scope of assets that can contribute to the security of decentralized networks, and unlocking the cryptoeconomic security of unlimited ERC-20 tokens on EigenLayer.
With this update, AVSs can choose to accept any ERC-20 token as a restaked asset to provide cryptoeconomic security for their AVS. This allows AVSs to evaluate the supply and utility of all available tokens to create cross-ecosystem partnerships while ensuring the safety and security of their services. This increases alignment and connectivity across the ecosystem, moving us closer to the ultimate goal of open innovation.
At the protocol level, new Strategies (smart contracts that define which tokens can be restaked on EigenLayer) can be created using a factory contract for any ERC-20 token. These tokens can then be included in quorums by AVSs for utilization as cryptoeconomic security and the distribution of operator tasks in return for AVS rewards.
In an upcoming update for the staking app user interface, restakers will be able to deposit and delegate these tokens to operators.
Currently, this feature is on testnet for a permissioned testing phase. EigenDA will be the first AVS to test and use permissionless token support.
Mainnet deployment, a protocol-level update, is scheduled for next week. User interface support for restakers on the EigenLayer web app will be added later in Q3.
================================================================================
Title: Introducing EigenDA Base Rewards

Last week EigenLayer experienced a major upgrade. The Rewards protocol, the onchain system that enables AVSs to distribute rewards to their stakers and operators, went live on mainnet on August 6th. The Rewards protocol upgrade grants AVSs the ability to begin rewarding stakers and operators for their past, present, and future support. See documentation here.
In addition to this upgrade, EigenLayer announced its initial proposal for programmatic incentives for ETH and EIGEN quorums which will boost AVS rewards with 4% of EIGEN’s total supply over the next year.
Today, EigenDA is announcing the EigenDA Base Rewards Program to take advantage of both of these developments. On Tuesday, August 13th, EigenDA will begin rewarding its stakers and operators with a relatively small amount of ETH each month. The monthly rewards will start at 10 ETH and ramp up over time.
We want EigenDA to qualify for the programmatic incentives program so that EigenDA stakers and operators are compensated for the security and work they contribute to running the network. The way the programmatic incentives program will work is it will distribute a certain amount of EIGEN each month to AVSs' stakers and operators in proportion to the amount of rewards that their AVS paid out of pocket.
Although the start date for qualifying for programmatic incentives has not been announced, EigenDA will start sending rewards to stakers and operators on Tuesday, August 13th, in order to test the EigenLayer rewards protocol and set a good example for the ecosystem. The initial 10 ETH will be distributed over 28 days, starting backdated on August 7th and continuing through September 4th, 2024. A monthly cadence will continue from there.
Given the proportional distribution of programmatic incentives, we want to start with a smaller reward to set a manageable benchmark for other AVSs to qualify for similar incentive rewards initially.
While the monthly rewards will begin at 10 ETH, we plan to gradually increase them until they fully cover the monthly operator expenses for EigenDA, which we estimate to be $160,000 across 400 operators, or $400 per operator. We want this to set a precedent for ecosystem participants, as we believe it’s essential for AVSs to adopt rewards models that at least cover operator costs.
Finally, let's quickly cover the endgame of EigenDA rewards. With EigenDA adoption picking up steam, we expect revenue from projects paying for EigenDA usage to greatly exceed $160,000 monthly. Once revenue starts flowing for EigenDA, most of this will be emitted to EigenDA stakers and operators via this same rewards mechanism.
With the upcoming launches of low-latency dispersal, 20MB/s throughput, permissionless rewards and data availability sampling, EigenDA seeks to establish itself as the premier solution for scaling Ethereum's write capacity. We look forward to building the future together with you.

================================================================================
Title: Coming Soon: AVS Rewards and EIGEN Programmatic Incentives

EigenLayer first launched contracts to mainnet on June 14, 2023. Today, EigenLayer has 4.8 million ETH and 108 million EIGEN restaked; 300+ operators running Actively Validated Services (AVSs); and 16 launched AVSs, with many more incoming.
The ultimate vision of the EigenLayer protocol is to be a permissionless marketplace for any blockchain protocol to elastically rent stake and high quality operator sets using both objective and intersubjective slashing conditions.
In the coming weeks, we take another major step toward this goal: the EigenLayer protocol will launch initial Rewards functionality, through which stakers and operators will be rewarded for their participation in securing EigenLayer AVSs. For the first time, token-based rewards will begin to flow through the protocol directly from AVSs to stakers and operators. This is an important step towards enabling price discovery for the value of stake and compute provided via EigenLayer.
Rewards enables AVSs to distribute tokens to their stakers and operators. Given the newness of the functionality, we expect AVSs to take time to integrate their systems with rewards. In the beginning, total rewards distributed directly by AVSs will likely be small. Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have solved this startup challenge in the past with programmatic rewards for participants who operate and use the protocol.
In order to activate the AVS rewards flywheel in EigenLayer, there will be a new programmatic incentives program designed for AVS “reward-boosts”, in which EIGEN will be automatically distributed to stakers and operators of each AVS proportionate to the amount of rewards distributed by each AVS. In effect, stakers and operators will receive more programmatic emissions by supporting AVSs that distribute more native rewards. Thus, the programmatic incentives program can be thought of as "boosting" the rewards paid by AVSs to their stakers and operators with EIGEN emissions.
For the first year, at least 4% of the total supply of EIGEN will be distributed via this program.
The goal of this design is to incentivize AVSs to begin distributing rewards to stakers and operators early, in order to benefit from and obtain a larger share of the early EIGEN programmatic incentives.
To support the growth of AVSs who are not ready to distribute rewards on Day 1, a small portion of EIGEN incentives will also be allocated to stakers and operators of AVSs that are not yet distributing rewards. This sets a rewards floor outside of the rewards-boost design, so all legitimate AVSs can distribute some rewards to stakers and operators. In this way, new AVSs are encouraged to join the EigenLayer ecosystem even if they are not ready to distribute rewards on their own.
After Rewards launches in the coming weeks, the programmatic incentives program will follow in the ensuing months. In the interim, the Eigen Foundation will share more details and specifications about the program: how exactly it will work, exactly how much EIGEN will be distributed programmatically, and how AVSs can most effectively participate.
Furthermore, the Season 2 distribution to stakers and operators is separate from these programmatic incentives, and details on that will be announced by the Eigen Foundation soon.
Stakers/Operators
Rewards, when available, will be claimable via both app.eigenlayer.xyz and the eigenlayer-cli. Please see the "Claim Rewards" documentation for a guide to claiming staker and operator rewards.
Note that because slashing is not live, operators can opt into as many AVSs as possible to earn rewards, with no incremental slashing risk. If operators are worried about future slashing risks, they should consider that EigenLayer will include a mechanism called "unique security" under which operators will be able to specify the amount of stake available to be slashed by each particular AVS that they are running. This is designed to mitigate slashing cascade risks that exist in other models. More details on unique security will be shared before the launch of slashing on EigenLayer.
AVS Developers
For full details on using Rewards as an AVS, please see the "AVS Integrations" documentation. For technical support, to discuss the Rewards roadmap, or to share feedback , please contact our team at [email protected].
As a preview, AVSs can customize a number of parameters in their rewards:
We appreciate your support and faith in the EigenLayer ecosystem. As the protocol continues to mature and become more fully-featured, and as the AVS ecosystem continues to grow in leaps and bounds, we expect the economy of EigenLayer to blossom and for stakers, operators, and all ecosystem participants alike to benefit.
We look forward to building the future together with you!

Title: Request for AVS: Uniswap v4 Hooks

Occasionally, you hear an idea so exciting that you see the future with utter clarity. At Eigen Labs, we’re excited to work with exceptional builders and hear their special insights about the world on a daily basis. We want to share some of ours with you. We’re starting a new series called Request for AVS to showcase how trustless offchain compute and data can change the onchain economy. We hope you join us for v1 😄
Uniswap v1 was a 0 to 1 innovation, bringing atomic swaps onchain.
Uniswap v2 extended v1’s functionalities, enabling us to trade ERC-20s in a single pool and enabling flash loans and oracles.
Uniswap v3 added concentrated liquidity, making LPing up to 4000x more capital efficient.
But Uniswap v4 is more. Rather than extend the functionalities of prior versions in an opinionated manner, it transitions Uniswap from an AMM to a platform for AMMs. It empowers builders to create any onchain exchange, using hooks to highly customize the trader and liquidity provider experience.
Previously, if builders wanted to innovate on AMM design, they had to build their own exchange, either competing with Uniswap or building on a new chain. But liquidity inherently has network effects, and exchanges are, therefore, a winner-take-all, or at least a winner-take-most game. In the past 24 hours, Uniswap has done 35% of all DeFi spot volume per DeFi Llama. On Ethereum and major L2s, Uniswap’s dominance increases to 62%.
Builders have to not just win on mechanism design, but attract enough liquidity to provide favorable prices to traders. This separation of liquidity and permissionless innovation has caused many exciting AMM designs to not take off. Uniswap v4 changes this, enabling anyone to tap into Uniswap’s liquidity with their mechanism.
To prove that Uniswap v4 is flexible enough to create any exchange, let’s use it to solve a classic problem: coincidence of wants. In a single block, some traders will swap USDC for ETH while others will swap ETH for USDC. With most onchain exchanges, both will trade against the liquidity pool, paying 0.3% in swap fees. Instead, they should swap with each other – saving both of them 0.3%. This is called the coincidence of wants.
We can design a hook to solve for coincidence of wants. Traders will send in orders to Uniswap v4. Rather than immediately getting matched against the pool, a hook can send orders to a matching engine to settle coincidences of wants against each other, which then settles to the overall pool. Traders then receive their desired asset, occasionally paying less in fees.
It’s important to ask: who runs this matching engine? Unfortunately, computing coincidence of wants expends too much gas onchain. We could send our orders to a centralized server. But that defeats the purpose of trading onchain altogether, leading to potential censorship and liveness issues.
If only there were a way to access trustless offchain compute…
Fortunately, EigenLayer enables trustless offchain compute (and data)! At a high level, EigenLayer is an infrastructure platform that gives you:
We call these decentralized networks Actively Validated Services (AVS)!
These operators can do a variety of tasks to boost the capabilities of Uniswap v4 hooks like:
By extending offchain compute and data to hooks, EigenLayer adds the missing piece for Uniswap v4 to recreate any onchain exchange.
The design space with v4 hooks and AVSs is endless! We will share 6 ideas briefly, but if you’re interested in building any, please reach out to us! We’d love to chat more :)
This is the example we talked about!
With the biggest decentralized exchange transitioning into a platform, there’s never been a better time to build onchain. Create any exchange with offchain compute and data as a Uniswap v4 hook AVS. If you’re interested in building any of these (or any other AVS), please dm on twitter @ishaan0x. Let’s chat :)

Title: EigenDA Dual Quorum and Production Traffic Announcement
We are supporting rollup production traffic on EigenDA mainnet available immediately. Anyone can now deploy their rollup and be whitelisted on our free tier. Interested rollup customers should fill out the EigenDA Contact Form in order to be approved for the initial free-tier usage phase. Please provide the ETH address associated with a new ECDSA keypair for authenticating your client with the EigenDA disperser. We strongly recommend that no funds be held by this contract address; see documentation and usage tutorial for further usage guidance. If you’d like to learn more about our reserved bandwidth tiers, please get in touch. As always, good places to get started are EigenDA documentation and the Holesky testnet.
Onboarding Rollups to Dual Quorum
One of the business models described in the EigenLayer whitepaper is the dual staking utility which can feature two quorums: ETH restakers and $AVS stakers. We are happy to announce that the dual quorum model we previously announced on Holesky testnet is now available on EigenDA mainnet. Initially, EigenDA dual quorum launches with ETH as the first quorum and EIGEN as the second quorum. This means that EIGEN holders will be able to stake to EigenDA operators, and those operators can opt in to EigenDA’s dual quorum, adding more security to the network. Following stakedrop claims on May 10, EigenDA currently has over 44M EIGEN staked and delegated.
We are working hard to extend this multiple quorum model to enable EigenDA rollups to stake their own custom tokens to secure blobs. More to come on this soon.
Each quorum backing a given EigenDA blob lends additional security, since the blob will remain available as long as there is a single quorum which has not been corrupted. Individual quorums can also provide additional security properties given the characteristics of the token being staked. EigenDA is currently building on a roadmap which will maximize the security provisioned by both the ETH and EIGEN Quorums:
This is a step towards our ambitious roadmap of providing the best data availability layer deeply integrated with tooling to enable open innovation.
Stake EIGEN now on EigenDA.
Mainnet Production Traffic
We recently announced that EigenDA is live on mainnet and we have been onboarding rollups for test traffic. After this final stage of testing and hardening, we are pleased to announce that EigenDA is now supporting production traffic for any rollup.
We have been working hard in sync with our community of restakers and DA operators to achieve our system performance goals in order to enable the next generation of blockchain applications. Today, EigenDA has over 230 operators and over 120,000 stakers delegating over 3.4M ETH to secure the network. Not only does this introduce the first alt-DA solution running in production secured by restaked ETH, it also holistically engages many pieces of the EigenLayer cryptoeconomic ecosystem to form a critical piece of infrastructure for the next era of services and applications.
For a limited time, any rollup may use EigenDA with throughput similar to production L2s for free. This is meant to showcase the advantages of the EigenDA product and be competitive with the EIP-4844 Dencun upgrade. For performance beyond these rates, and to reserve bandwidth in advance, please get in touch with the team.
Interested rollup customers should fill out the EigenDA Contact Form in order to be approved for the initial free-tier usage phase. EigenDA currently supports ECDSA authentication to facilitate fast, early-stage integrations. Please provide the ETH address associated with a new ECDSA keypair for authenticating your client with the EigenDA disperser. We strongly recommend that no funds be held by this contract address, and if you are building a rollup, that this is a different from your sequencer address; see documentation and usage tutorial for further usage guidance. If you’d like to learn more about our reserved bandwidth tiers, please get in touch. As always, good places to get started are EigenDA documentation and the Holesky testnet.
Onboarding the first rollups onto EigenDA mainnet is the next stage of a multi-stage launch towards the endgame for data availability for the Ethereum ecosystem. Read more at our mainnet launch announcement about new brand new use cases enabled as well as EigenDA benefits such as hyperscalability, cost flexibility, ease of integration, and native token staking.

Title: Introducing the EigenLayer Security Model: A Novel Approach to Operating and Securing Decentralized Services

Eigen Labs is excited to introduce the EigenLayer Security Model, an evolution of our previous model, in preparation for the upcoming ‘Slashing’ protocol feature release.
This blog post is a simple description of how EigenLayer empowers AVSs to operate more efficiently and create economically aligned incentives using three foundational concepts: Operator Sets, Total Stake, and Unique Stake. In upcoming articles, we will dive deeper into the technical details of the planned protocol updates, uncovering the full potential and advantages of EigenLayer’s innovative design.
For additional context, we have included in the appendix a brief description of what properties this new model is trying to achieve in comparison to the original.1
An Operator Set is a group of operators who have been delegated ETH by stakers and are assigned certain tasks by an AVS. Although EigenLayer accepts many different types of tokens, and multiple tokens can be used in a single Operator Set, for simplicity, we will proceed using only staked ETH, which we will refer to simply as ETH.
Stakers delegate ETH to operators who participate in various Operator Sets created by AVSs.2 To join Operator Sets, operators send requests to the respective AVSs for inclusion. AVSs can reward operators within an Operator Set if they perform their assigned tasks correctly and impose penalties if they do not. An AVS can create as many different Operator Sets as it wants.
The total amount of ETH delegated to an operator is the Total Stake of that operator. An Operator Set’s Total Stake is the sum of all its operators Total Stake. For example, if there are 3 operators in an Operator Set and each has 100 ETH delegated to them, then the Total Stake for each operator is 100 ETH, and the Total Stake for that Operator Set is 300 ETH.
Operators allocate a percentage of their ETH that an Operator Set is permitted to slash. An operator’s total allocation across Operator Sets must be between 0% and 100%. In other words, a unit of ETH can only be slashed by a single Operator Set at any given time. The allocated amount of ETH is called the operator's Unique Stake for that Operator Set.
If a task is performed incorrectly, the Operator Set may choose to slash an operator for up to that amount as defined by the AVS. The Unique Stake of an Operator Set is the amount of ETH exclusively slashable by that Operator Set.
Building on our previous example, if an AVS has one Operator Set and the three operators allocate 0%, 10%, and 20% of their ETH to it, their Unique Stake would be 0, 10 and 20 ETH, respectively, totaling 30 ETH in Unique Stake for the Operator Set.
AVSs can use the Total Stake and Unique Stake of an Operator Set for security. For example, consider an AVS creates a single Operator Set which has operators perform a task and vote on its output. The output that receives more than 50% of the stake-weighted vote is deemed correct. We assume that all pre-existing operators are honest and cannot be bribed to corrupt the task.
Using the numbers from our previous example, if the Operator Set weighs votes solely by Total Stake, a new malicious operator could manipulate the task’s result (attack) by allocating slightly more than 300 ETH in Total Stake (eg. 301 ETH). Without the ability to slash, no penal action can be taken against this operator besides ejection from the Operator Set.
To use slashing as a punitive disincentive for misbehavior, the Operator Set can instead weigh votes by Unique Stake. In this case, the malicious operator would need to allocate just over 30 ETH in Unique Stake to carry out an attack (e.g. 30.1 ETH). Afterward, the Operator Set can slash the malicious operator for 30.1 ETH. While this imposes a tangible economic penalty, it significantly lowers the capital requirement from 301 ETH to 30.1 ETH.
An Operator Set could also require agreement between votes based on both Total Stake and Unique Stake, effectively balancing their weaknesses and leveraging their strengths. This approach forces a new malicious operator to meet the higher threshold of 301 ETH in Total Stake to compromise the task’s result while committing 30.1 ETH in Unique Stake that can be slashed after the attack. Thus, the Total Stake raises the capital required to corrupt the task, while the Unique Stake ensures an economic penalty for the malicious operator.
Thus far, we have provided a simplified demonstration of how this security model works. In reality, Operator Sets are far more versatile. For example, an Operator Set can include multiple tasks and tokens, none of which need to be ETH. It can specify slashing conditions for different types of tokens, tasks, and infractions, as well as define confirmation rules for the set of tasks. An Operator Set can determine which tokens will be used to reward operators and how these rewards will be distributed. This model is also extensible to accommodate various preferences for handling slashed stake, including burning or redistribution (see StakeSure), although redistribution will not be available in the initial slashing release. Finally, because an Operator Set’s Unique Stake is only slashable by that specific Operator Set, slashing is localized, eliminating the need for a common veto committee.
In future articles we will delve into the nuances of the security model, why it is an improvement over other models, and other components that are actively being researched.
1 What is the new model trying to accomplish?
The original security model had the following structure: each operator can opt into a subset of AVSs, and the entire stake delegated to that operator could be slashed by any of those AVSs, which meant:
The new EigenLayer security model described in the blog post above has been specifically designed to address these shortcomings by offering greater flexibility and control:
2 Stakers can delegate to only one operator per address. For example, as shown in Figure 1, stakers collectively have delegated 100 ETH to each of the three operators. However, behind the scenes, each staker uses three separate addresses, with each one delegating to a specific operator.
Consider Figure 5 below in the context of Figure 1:
